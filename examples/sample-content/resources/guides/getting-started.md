# Getting Started with MCP ACDC

Welcome to the **Agent Content Discovery Companion (ACDC)** server!

ACDC is designed to help AI agents discover and search through your local documentation and resources.

## Key Concepts

- **Resources**: Markdown files organized in your content directory.
- **Metadata**: An `mcp-metadata.yaml` file that defines your server and tools.
- **Search**: Full-text search capabilities powered by Bleve.

## How to use this example

1. Explore the files in the `resources` directory.
2. Observe how YAML frontmatter is used to provide resource metadata.
3. Use the `search` tool to find content across these files.
