server:
  name: MCP Acdc Server (Go)
  version: 1.0.0
  instructions: |
    MCP ACDC provides development resources and tools through the Model Context Protocol.

    This server demonstrates the Docker content mount pattern, where content is provided
    via a separate content image that can be versioned and deployed independently.

    Use resources for broad context (standards, guidelines, best practices).
    Use the search tool to find specific information across all resources.

tools:
  - name: search
    description: |
      Search across all development resources using full-text search. This tool searches resource names, descriptions, and content to help you find relevant standards, guidelines, and documentation.

      WHEN TO USE: Use this as your first step before generating code or reviewing implementations. Search for relevant topics to discover which resources apply to your task.

      HOW IT WORKS: Searches are performed across resource names, descriptions, and full markdown content. Results include the resource name, URI, and a relevant text snippet showing where your query was found.

  - name: read
    description: |
      Read the full content of a specified resource. This tool allows you to retrieve the complete markdown content of any development resource using its URI.

      WHEN TO USE: Use this after you have found a relevant resource URI (e.g., via the search tool or by listing resources) and need to read its full content to understand specific standards, guidelines, or instructions.

      HOW IT WORKS: Provide the URI of the resource you wish to read (e.g., 'acdc://guides/getting-started.md'). The tool returns the full markdown content of the resource with frontmatter removed.
