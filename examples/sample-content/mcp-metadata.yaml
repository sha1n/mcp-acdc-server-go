  name: ACDC Sample Content
  version: 1.0.0
  instructions: |
    You have access to a curated set of development resources and prompts served by the ACDC MCP server.

    Content is organized into two areas:
    - **guides/** — Onboarding and authoring walkthroughs.
    - **reference/** — Configuration options and search-engine details.

    Workflow:
    1. Use the `search` tool first to find resources relevant to the user's question.
    2. Use the `read` tool to retrieve the full content of a specific resource by its URI (e.g., `acdc://guides/getting-started`).
    3. Use prompts (like `explain-topic` or `check-config`) when the user needs guided, structured assistance.

    The URI scheme defaults to `acdc://` but can be changed with the `--uri-scheme` flag.

tools:
  - name: search
    description: |
      Search across all development resources using full-text search. This tool searches resource names, descriptions, and content to help you find relevant standards, guidelines, and documentation.

      WHEN TO USE: Use this as your first step before generating code or reviewing implementations. Search for relevant topics to discover which resources apply to your task.

      HOW IT WORKS: Searches are performed across resource names, descriptions, and full markdown content. Results include the resource name, URI, and a relevant text snippet showing where your query was found.

  - name: read
    description: |
      Read the full content of a specified resource. This tool allows you to retrieve the complete markdown content of any development resource using its URI.

      WHEN TO USE: Use this after you have found a relevant resource URI (e.g., via the search tool or by listing resources) and need to read its full content to understand specific standards, guidelines, or instructions.

      HOW IT WORKS: Provide the URI of the resource you wish to read (e.g., 'acdc://guides/getting-started.md'). The tool returns the full markdown content of the resource with frontmatter removed.
